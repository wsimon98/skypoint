# SkyPoint

SkyPoint is a custom firmware fork for the ESP32-C3-based Xteink X3 and X4 e-ink readers. It is based on the open-source [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader) project and extends it with reader dark mode, per-book dark-mode overrides, a re-skinned home screen with cover thumbnails, and SkyPoint branding (boot splash, sleep screen, on-device wordmark).

The repository also bundles a self-contained WebSerial flash page in [`flasher/`](flasher/) — adapted from the archived [xteink-flasher](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/xteink-flasher) — so the firmware can be written to a device directly from Chrome or Edge without any vendor tooling.

## What's in this repo

- **Firmware source** — PlatformIO project at the repo root. Builds with `pio run -e default`. Output is `.pio/build/default/firmware.bin`.
- **`flasher/`** — static HTML/JS flash bench. Open `flasher/index.html` (or serve it locally) in Chrome/Edge, plug an X3/X4 in over USB, point it at a `firmware.bin`, write.
- **`install.sh` / `install.bat`** — one-shot setup scripts that install PlatformIO and run a clean build.

> If you're planning to buy an Xteink device, consider purchasing an **X3/X4 Developer Edition** through https://crosspointreader.com. CrossPoint receives a small share of each sale, helping fund development costs.

## Differences from upstream CrossPoint

- Reader **dark mode** as a system-wide toggle (Settings → Display → Dark Mode) with per-book overrides stored alongside each book's progress file.
- New **SkyPoint UI theme** as the default for fresh installs: 3 recent-book covers across the top, a 2-column tile-grid main menu, and a "SkyPoint" wordmark in the header.
- New SkyPoint **boot splash and sleep screen** assets (fox logo + wolf sleep art) that auto-select between the X3 (528×792) and X4 (480×800) panels.
- Cosmetic rebrand of user-facing strings (`CrossPoint` → `SkyPoint`) without touching the on-disk `/.crosspoint` cache paths or the KOReader sync `DEVICE_ID`, both of which would break existing data if renamed.

The on-disk format and partition layout are unchanged from CrossPoint, so flashing SkyPoint over a stock CrossPoint install (or vice versa) preserves your books, reading positions, settings, and Wi-Fi credentials.

## What can CrossPoint do?

- **Reader engine**: EPUB 2/3 rendering with embedded-style option, image handling, hyphenation, kerning, chapter navigation, footnotes, bookmarks, go-to-percent, auto page turn, orientation control, focus reading, KOReader progress sync and more. 

- **Screenshots.**

- **Custom fonts**: install your favorite fonts on the SD card.

- **Tilt page turn (X3 only)**.

- **Library workflow**: folder browser, hidden-file toggle, long-press delete, recent books, SD-cache management.

- **Wireless workflows**:
  
  - File transfer web UI
  - EPUB Optimizer
  - Web settings UI/API (edit many device settings from browser)
  - WebSocket fast uploads
  - WebDAV handler
  - AP mode (hotspot) and STA mode (join existing Wi-Fi), both with QR helpers
  - Calibre wireless connect flow
  - OPDS browser with saved servers (up to 8), search, pagination, and direct download
  - OTA update checks and installs from GitHub releases

- **Customization**: multiple themes (Classic, Lyra, Lyra Extended, RoundedRaff), sleep screen modes, front/side button remapping, status bar controls, power-button behavior, refresh cadence, and more.

- **Localization**: 24 UI languages and counting. RTL support.

### Coming soon:

- Dictionary lookup — inline word lookup without leaving the reader.

- More themes.

- Much more! stay tuned.

## USB-locked devices (Xteink Unlocker)

Some Xteink units purchased from third-party stores (e.g. AliExpress) ship with USB flashing locked from the factory.
If your device is locked, you will need to use the **Xteink Unlocker** tool available at
https://crosspointreader.com/#unlock-tool before you can flash CrossPoint.

**You do not need this tool if you bought your device directly from xteink.com.** Those units are not locked.

**Not sure if your device is locked?** Power it on, connect the USB-C cable, and try flashing via the web flasher first (see
[Install firmware](#install-firmware) below). If the browser's serial device picker does not show your device, try a different
USB port or browser before assuming the device is locked. Only reach for the unlocker if the device still doesn't appear.

> ### ⚠️ WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THE UNLOCKER ⚠️
> 
> **The only officially supported firmwares in the unlock tool are CrossPoint and CrossInk.**
> 
> Flashing any other firmware on a USB-locked device may **permanently brick the device** or leave it **permanently
> stuck on that firmware with no recovery path**. Once USB flashing is re-locked, your only way back is via OTA, and if
> the firmware you flashed doesn't support OTA, **there is no way out**.

## Install firmware

### Web installer (recommended)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), and choose an official CrossPoint release.

### Web installer (specific version)

1. Connect your device to your computer via USB-C and wake/unlock the device
2. Download a `firmware.bin` from [Releases](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases), local build, or continuous integration artifact.
3. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools, select device (X3 or X4), click "Custom .bin" and upload a `firmware.bin`.

### Revert to Official Firmware

To revert to the official firmware, you can also flash the latest official firmware using https://crosspointreader.com/#flash-tools.

### Command line

1. Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool):

```bash
pip install esptool
```

2. Download `firmware.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases).
3. Connect your device via USB-C.
4. Find the device port. On Linux, run `dmesg` after connecting. On macOS:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.iokit"' --info
```

5. Flash:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x10000 /path/to/firmware.bin
```

Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` to match your system.

### Manual

See [Development quick start](#development-quick-start) below.

## Custom SD-card fonts

Convert your own TTF/OTF files into `.cpfont` files that load from the SD card. No firmware reflash is needed.

1. Go to https://crosspointreader.com/fonts and open the "SD-card font builder" form.
2. Upload up to four styles (regular, bold, italic, bold-italic), set the family name, point sizes, and Unicode range.
3. Download the generated `.cpfont` files.
4. Copy them to your SD card under `/fonts/YourFont/` (or `/.fonts/YourFont/` to hide the folder).
5. Select the font on the device from the font settings.

Conversion runs the firmware repo's `lib/EpdFont/scripts/fontconvert_sdcard.py` script unmodified, so output matches a local host build.

## Development quick start

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/pioarduino) or VS Code + pioarduino plugin
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer

### Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader
cd crosspoint-reader

# if cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build / flash / monitor

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### Contributor pre-PR checks

```bash
./bin/clang-format-fix
pio check -e default
pio run -e default
```

### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

## Building from source

```sh
# Linux / macOS
./install.sh

# Windows
install.bat
```

Both scripts install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) via `pipx` (installing `pipx` first if missing) and run `pio run -e default`. The resulting `firmware.bin` will be at `.pio/build/default/firmware.bin`.

## Flashing

1. Build the firmware (above) or grab a prebuilt `firmware.bin`.
2. Open `flasher/index.html` in Chrome or Edge on desktop (WebSerial doesn't work in Firefox/Safari).
3. Plug the X3 or X4 in over USB.
4. Pick the model, select your `firmware.bin`, click flash.

The flasher writes to the inactive OTA slot and only swaps the boot pointer on success — a failed flash leaves the previous firmware bootable. Books on the SD card and saved settings are not touched.

## Credits

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the
cache. This cache directory exists at `.crosspoint` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:

```text
.crosspoint/
├── epub_<hash>/         # one directory per book, named by content hash
│   ├── progress.bin     # reading position (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # generated cover image
│   ├── book.bin         # metadata: title, author, spine, TOC
│   ├── css_rules.cache  # parsed CSS rule cache
│   ├── img_*            # rendered image cache files
│   └── sections/        # per-chapter layout cache
│       ├── 0.bin
│       ├── 1.bin
│       └── ...
├── settings.json        # device settings
├── state.json           # resume/runtime state
└── recent.json          # recent books list
```

Removing `/.crosspoint` clears all cached metadata and forces a full regeneration on next open. Book deletes, overwrites, and moves done through the firmware or web UI clear or re-key matching caches; manual SD-card edits may leave stale cache directories behind.

## Community forks

One of the best things about open source is that anyone can take the code in a different direction. If you need something outside CrossPoint's [scope](./SCOPE.md), check out the community forks:

- [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) — Typography and reading tracking: Bionic Reading (bolds word stems to create fixation points), guide dots between words, improved paragraph indents, and replaces the default fonts with ChareInk/Lexend/Bitter.

- [papyrix-reader](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-reader) — Adds FB2 and MD format support. Actively maintained with Arabic script support. Custom themes via SD card.

- ~~[crosspet](https://github.com/trilwu/crosspet) — A Vietnamese fork that adds a Tamagotchi-style virtual chicken that grows based on your reading milestones (pages read, streaks, care). Also: Flashcards, Weather, Pomodoro timer, and mini-games.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-cjk](https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk) — Purpose-built for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean reading.

- [inx](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx) — Completely reimagines the user interface with tabbed navigation.

- ~~[PlusPoint](https://github.com/ngxson/pluspoint-reader) — custom JS apps support.~~ (Unmaintained)

- [crosspoint-reader-papers3](https://github.com/juicecultus/crosspoint-reader-papers3) — Crosspoint port for M5Stack Paper S3. 

- [t5s3-reader](https://github.com/ShallowGreen123/t5s3-reader) — Crosspoint port for LilyGo T5 ePaper S3 / T5S3 4.7-inch e-paper device.

**Note:** Many of these features will make their way into CrossPoint over time. We maintain a slower pace to ensure rock-solid stability and squash bugs before they reach your device.
